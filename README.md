My [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com) adventures. Structured like I would a real project in production.

#### *Please Note:*

I do all the input parsing in the test setup because nobody cares about seeing input parsing.
Every Time.

I parse the input to match what I would expect as a function input in a real Elixir application.
In this way, I'm just working on the interesting parts.

### Dev

Do what you want.

```
mix deps.get
```

To play with the application in `iex`:

```
iex -S mix
```


### Testing

```
mix test
```
